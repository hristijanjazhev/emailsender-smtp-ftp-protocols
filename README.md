# FTPMailSenderApp
#Menu which gives you 3 possible answers (pay attention to the part with password): 1)Send Mail through a console,2)Do FTP on a server and 3) Quit
1#
▬So,what first option allows you as a user is asking for typing your email address,ask for adding password,allows you to choose who's gonna be a BCC(BlindCarbonCopy),who's gonna be a CC(CarbonCopy), asking for typing Subject and Body of the message and the final part email who you want to receive the message.
*I wanted to mention about the part with the password...
Function of EmailSender which i made, it's succesffull only by adding Generated password which i need to give you to access for sending the mail ,is by having a Generated Passowrd, and reason is beacuse i was wondering for privacy and security at begging of the code so that's where i end it.*Feel free to share your idea about it*
-Password is : cxcrcabqcrhmofpj 
2#
▬Also at the option 2)Do FTP on a server there is one situation where you need to access to specified application which allows you to connect to a server where you can work with files.
-Which means,you need to have Fille Zilla and implement the correct credentials to the server. *which they are inside code*
▬Next part is where i put class for CRUD-*CreateReadeUpdateDelete* and plus checking if the file exists in the Server 
▬Doing this process i had a proper Menu with switch cases and implemented methods for linking the pages.
3#
Adding enviorment method for automathically close the program.
#Feel free to share your thoughts.
